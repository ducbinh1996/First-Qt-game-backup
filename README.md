The Matching Game (or Memory Game)

What we want:

	- More than 1 wigdet
	- Able to set the size of the cards of the game (grid size to be 8x8 at default)
	- A counter to count player's moves
	- A timer to limit the time
	- Maybe a share button to share the screenshot of the game

What we did learn:

	- The usage of git stash
	- How to create pull request and why
